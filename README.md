## This fork

... is just some messing around for personal use. On the custom branch:
- Reusable TMs, but very unfancy (they just don't get deleted)
- Changed day/night times, it's day from 10am-22pm 
- Changed player sprite, it's Laura from prism
- Reverted the type chart to normal gen2 gold/silver
- Lowered the prices of coins in the game corner
- Changed the colors of the cities slightly
- Changed the color of the night majorly
- Probably more things I forgot
